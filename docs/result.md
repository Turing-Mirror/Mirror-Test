# Anime Summer 2026 Source Basis

## Source

This repository's Summer 2026 anime test is based on:

- `/Users/kara/Code/material/26July-Anime-Test/result.md`
- GitHub repository: [Kara251/26July-Anime-Test](https://github.com/Kara251/26July-Anime-Test)

That file is the upstream research note used to define the candidate pool, screening rules, and recommendation dimensions for the test.

The live site no longer depends on the sibling project during build. The current in-repo implementation lives under `tests-src/anime-summer-2026/`.

## Scope

The source note uses this inclusion rule:

- 2026 July-August Japanese summer anime window
- TV anime
- web / streaming anime
- sequels
- shorts / specials
- animated films

The test implementation in this repository then narrows that research pool into a product-facing recommendation set.

## Product Constraints Derived From The Source

### Included focus

- Japanese ACG works only
- works suitable for personality-style recommendation output
- works that can support weighted recommendation and weighted avoidance

### Excluded or de-emphasized

- non-Japanese / Western family-animation entries
- entries with weak fit for the site's ACG tone
- items better used as side recommendations than main result cards

In code, this is reflected by explicit exclusion of several non-target poster assets during build output.

## Main Result Pool Direction

The source note recommends keeping the main result pool relatively tight so the test still feels like a personality match rather than a giant catalog.

The implementation here follows that spirit by centering the result pool around works such as:

- `supermarket_smoking`
- `ghost_shell`
- `bleach_tybw`
- `mushoku_iii`
- `youjo_senki_ii`
- `black_torch`
- `grand_blue_s3`
- `polar_opposites_s2`
- `young_ladies_fighting_games`
- `jaadugar`
- `sparks_of_tomorrow`
- `goodbye_lara`
- `old_bumpkin_sword`
- `ibikona`
- `100_girlfriends_s3`
- `paprika_4k`
- `madoka_walpurgis`
- `chiikawa_mermaid`

The final in-repo pool is defined in [tests-src/anime-summer-2026/data.js](../tests-src/anime-summer-2026/data.js).

## Test Axes Derived From The Source

The source note recommends mapping users by viewing state and temperament, not only by genre labels.

That recommendation became the current trait model:

- intensity
- humor
- intimacy
- wonder
- futurism
- darkness
- community
- mastery
- artiness
- legacy

These traits drive:

- per-question scoring
- weighted best-match recommendations
- weighted "maybe avoid" results
